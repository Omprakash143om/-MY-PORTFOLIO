        Hello! I'm Anantha Omprakash, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Technology at Madanapalle Institute of Technology & Science, Madanapalle. My academic journey has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and growth, as reflected in my CGPA of 8.77. I graduated from Sri Siddartha Junior College, Madanapalle, with a remarkable score of 96.2% and completed my S.S.C from Sri Chaitanya English Medium High School with a 9.8 GPA.

        My passion lies in the fields of Python programming, data science, and database management systems. I have undertaken multiple internships, including a data science internship at HDLC Technologies, where I worked on the classification of datasets using KNN and SVM algorithms. Additionally, I gained practical experience in Python programming during my internship at YBI Foundation, and I developed skills in WordPress development during my time at Infinity Spark India Pvt Ltd.

        Beyond academics, I am keenly interested in various areas, including web development, where I have experience using WordPress and Figma. My technical skill set includes languages such as Python, SQL, and HTML, with a strong foundation in database management with MySQL.
